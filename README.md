# 100 Days of Javascript

Inspired by Jennifer Dewalt's [180 websites in 180 days](http://jenniferdewalt.com/index.html) and Elle Luna's [100 day project](https://thegreatdiscontent.com/100days).

## The Rules

1. I will do 100 small JavaScript projects.
2. There's no time limit on how long an individual exercise can take.
3. Perfect is the enemy of good. I will not be afraid of making mistakes.
4. I will ask for help when I need it.

## The Projects

1. **Literary Quotes** - Randomly cycling through quotes from books I've read
